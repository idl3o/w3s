The job is failing because the specified Python version (3.7) is not found in the local cache. Here's a step-by-step solution to fix this issue:

1. **Update Python Version in Workflow**:
   - Modify the workflow file to use a supported Python version. You can check the available versions [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/actions/python-versions/main/versions-manifest.json).

2. **Edit the Workflow File (`.github/workflows/django.yml`)**:
   - Update the `python-version` key to use a version that is available (e.g., 3.8 or 3.9).

Here is an example of how you can update the workflow file:

```yaml
name: Django CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9]  # Update to available versions

    steps:
    - name: Check out repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        python manage.py test
```

3. **Commit and Push Changes**:
   - After making the above changes, commit and push them to your repository. This should trigger the workflow again and use the updated Python versions.

4. **Verify the Fix**:
   - Ensure that the workflow runs successfully with the updated Python versions.

By updating the Python version in your workflow file, you should be able to resolve the issue and allow the job to complete successfully.
